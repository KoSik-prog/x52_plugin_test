# x52pro_plugin

Saitek X52 PRO plugin for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 VER 2.0

Your X52 LED's will run dynamically with this plugin.

what's new in ver 2.0: 
- added the ability to configure LED's

Run saitek_settings.exe to set up the LED's 



You can use the autostart.bat file to run the plugin together with MSFS2020, but you have to edit it beforehand and insert the game path:
- open msfs shortcut properties
- copy Target
- edit autostart.bat file
- paste your target path into a file
- create shortcut with autostart.bat target

Have fun!!!
